Usage Tips
==========

You "win" the game by getting a 7 in one of the spinner windows
when you click the Spin button. By my calculations, you will win
the game about 28% of the time. Have fun!

==============
UNINSTALLATION
==============

To Uninstall in Microsoft Windows 98, ME, or 2000:

Click the Start button, click Settings, and then click Control
Panel. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool to remove "Lucky" from
the list of installed programs.
